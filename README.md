Experimental version of Tile World 2.2.0 for Macintosh.

To compile and run it you need [qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (version 1) installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

To compile just run `./make.sh` from the command line.

`./make.sh install` will (hopefully) create an app bundle and move it to the /Applications folder.
