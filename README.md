Experimental version of Tile World 2.2.0 for Macintosh. Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the Atari
Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville.

To compile and run it you need [qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (version 1) installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

To compile just run `./make.sh` from the command line.

`./make.sh install` will (hopefully) create an app bundle and move it to the /Applications folder.
